## What is FTC?

•FIRST Tech Challenge is the ultimate Sport for the Mind. 

•High-school student participants . 

•Under strict rules, limited time and resources, teams of students are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," hone teamwork skills, and build and program industrial-size robots to play a difficult field game against like-minded competitors. 

•It’s as close to real-world engineering as a student can get. 

•Volunteer professional mentors lend their time and talents to guide each team.
